# Bot education

This is a bot which can teach you many school subjects like history and geography.
It creates quizzes and corrects your mistakes.

## How to install the bot ?

- You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) before starting.
- Follow the first step of [the tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-a-discord-bot-with-node-js) called: *Setting Up a Discord Bot*. It allows to create a bot that we will use afterwards.
- Download the code (click on the *Code* button and click on *Download ZIP*) and unzip the file.
- Open this folder with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 
- Copy token from the [portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) (click on the name of your bot and click on bot tab and copy the token) and paste it on the VSC's file *config.json*. :warning: **It's preferable to share this token with nobody**.
- Run `npm i` in the console.

## How to run and close the bot ?

- Write on terminal `node index.js` and the bot will run.
- Hit `Ctrl` + `C` and the bot will close.
